# vue-routing

Install vue router with the following command: 

'''
npm install --save vue-router
'''

### Information

- Default mode is /#/ for routing. /#/ Enables the frontend to handle routing on it's own without sending requests to the server. Part in front of the hashtag is sent to the server... the part after the hashtag is handled by the application on it's own.
- The hashtag is called history mode.
- Learn more about this on: <a>www.router.vuejs.org</a>

- :id is a flexible element inside our url, this is how we create dynamic urls.
